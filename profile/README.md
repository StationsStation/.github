# Mission Statement

“To push innovation of autonomy past the point of human intervention by automating the end to end operations of conceptualising, designing, developing and deploying an autonomous service on Olas.”


# Public Repositories

Repositories are structured in the form of stations.

Stations are self contained repositories which contain the necessary agent-based components in order to accomplish a specific set of activities within the web3 space.

Additional components are developed within the station repos such that they are reusable modular and easy to maintain on and off-chain.
